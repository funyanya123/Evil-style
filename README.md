I used the OpenCV library, version 4.7.0, for this program. OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning library that provides various functions and algorithms for image and video processing tasks. You can find the library on GitHub at https://github.com/opencv/opencv and visit their official website at https://opencv.org/ for more information.
